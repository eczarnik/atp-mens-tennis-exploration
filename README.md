## Data
The data comes from a collection of ATP Men's Tennis data tracked on GitHub. For the purposes of this analysis, match data from 2022 was utilized and includes a variety of player attributes such as age, height, handedness, tourneys played in, wins, lossess, etc. View the [2022 ATP Men's Tennis data] (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp/master/atp_matches_2022.csv)

## Objective
The goal of the project was to learn more about the men's professional tennis player's competing at the highest level in the four Grand Slam Tournmanets (the Australian Open, the French Open (also known as Roland Garros), Wimbledon, and the US Open). I was curious to understand if a player's age or handedness has an impact on the number of their wins and lossess, if there was a relationship between a winner's height and the number of aces they scored, and if there was a relationship between a winner's age and the total length of a match.
